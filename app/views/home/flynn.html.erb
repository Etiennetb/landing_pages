		<h2>Whatever you need, Flynn can help.</h2>
		<h3> Getting apps running in the cloud is way too hard.</h3>

	</header>

		<p>
		    Deployment. Ops. Databases. Containers. Configuration management.
		    Service discovery. Forget about all of them.
    	</p>

	    <p>
	      Flynn is all you need to know.
	    </p>

	      surface. So you get all the benefits with none of the work or complexity.

		<h3>Growth is hard.</h3>
	</header>
	<div>
	
	<p>
      Users love your product and you're growing like crazy.  Your engineering
      team is already stretched thin keeping up with growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      You're using more cloud instances, apps, containers, languages,
      frameworks, and databases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your ops team (if you have one) is already under water trying to keep up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flynn helps you breeze through those challenges.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developers can deploy with a single command straight from git. Operators
      manage a single platform instead of doing custom work before each app can
      be deployed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Databases manage themselves. Service discovery, scheduling, containers,
      routing, and cluster management are all taken care of in the background.
    </p>

		<h3>Your world is changing too quickly.</h3>
	</header>

	<div>

    <p>
      New languages, frameworks, version control systems, databases,
      architectures, and other bleeding-edge technologies are taking over,
      fast.
    </p>

    <p>
      You need containers, microservices, polyglot everything, and cost savings
      yesterday.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developers need the best tools for the job in a changing world. Operators
      and IT teams need a platform they can manage instead of building
      everything from scratch, one piece at a time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flynn has you covered. All the shiny new best practices in a single
      turnkey solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's free and open source so you can have tomorrow's technology today
      without any lock-in.

		<h3>We can run it for you.</h3>

    manage a Flynn cluster for you. We work with your developers to help you
    get the most out of Flynn and your apps. And since Flynn is 100% open
    source there's no lock-in.
    </p>

    handle things yourself but still want help on call.
